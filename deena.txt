Youth Ministry Update

Hello everyone. I just wanted to send you a quick email to remind you what is going on with the youth the next two weeks.

This Sunday, Jan 12: Sunday School will be led by Julie Davis. 

Next Sunday, Jan 19: No Sunday School. Youth may attend the intergenational class with James Heimlech that meets on the basement level. Most of the youth will be in Green Lake, Wisconsin for their annual ski trip 

Let me know if you have any questions.
